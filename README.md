## Project Description

This project was for a short-term design studio that required applied deep learning and linking of existing models for spatial design. Special thanks to SUNS for providing us with data.
The controlnet training model and inference model is credited to fffiloni, the inpainting model belongs to Runwayml, while the depthmap generation to GLTF model is credited to Radam√©s Ajna.
